## Project Overview

Build a platform (with Google login only) that provides users with:

- A publicly available **CRUD Platform website** to get API Key & URL  
- A lightweight **NPM library** to interact with the CRUD library  
- A **Todo app frontend** that consumes this library using `npm install`
